Description: fish converts video files to binary images and simply analyzes the shape of a region of interest (ROI). It was developed to automate kinematic analysis of undulatory locomotion using highly contrasted video data produced from backlighting an animal. fish converts a video to binary images and then to matrices to determine a column-wise midpoint of ROI pixels is determined. tThis, in turn, determines the midline coordinates and from these data one can calculate important kinematic parameters including amplitude, frequency, wavelength, etc.
